GNU ed originated with the editor algorithm from Brian W. Kernighan & P.
J. Plauger's wonderful book "Software Tools in Pascal," Addison-Wesley,
1981.  GNU ed has also benefitted from the contributions of numerous people
who reported problems, suggested various improvements or submitted actual
code.  Among these are the following.
